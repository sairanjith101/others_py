An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.

~~~~~~

Itâ€™s very easy to conclude that if length of two strings are not equal they are not anagrams 
Since there is always a missing letter among them.

eg.
"silent" & "listen" 	-	True
"night" & "thing"	-	True
"abcd" & "dcb"		-	False
"def" & "fed"		-	True
